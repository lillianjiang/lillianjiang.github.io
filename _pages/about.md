I am Lillian Yushu Jiang, a Ph.D. candidate at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Brendan Bowler](https://www.as.utexas.edu/~bpbowler/). My research primarily focuses on discovering and characterizing exoplanets, understanding planet formation with high-contrast adaptive optics imaging. I graduated with a B.A. in Astronomy and Computer Science from Smith College, where I first delved into the exciting realms of exoplanets with [Kimberly Ward-Duong](https://kward-duong.space/) and [Kate Follette](https://www.follettelab.com/). In addition to my work in astronomy, I have a strong interest in computation creativity and machine learning.
