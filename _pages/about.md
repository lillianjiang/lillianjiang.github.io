I am a fourth-year PhD student in Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, specializing in **observational exoplanets and substellar astrophysics**. My research focuses on understanding how planets and planet-mass companions form and evolve in their earliest stages, particularly at wide orbital separations where the boundary between planets and brown dwarfs becomes most intriguing.

Using **high-contrast imaging** and **multiwavelength observations**, I study young planetary-mass companions, their accretion variability, and their circumplanetary environments. This work helps us understand the diverse formation pathways of objects in the planetary-to-substellar mass regime and provides insights into the physical processes that shape these worlds during their formative years.

My research combines cutting-edge observational techniques with detailed analysis to probe the properties of these elusive objects, contributing to our broader understanding of planet formation and evolution across the full spectrum of orbital architectures.
